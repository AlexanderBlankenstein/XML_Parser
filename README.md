XML File Parcer - Will read any XML file format and display it within the console.
Cool things used and included with this project, as an example. 
- C
- XML
- Make files
- a little bash scripting

# to Run:

Ensure Make works on your environment,
'make clean' and 'make build',
this will make all required parser files.
'make run', will run the parser.
you can also add any xml file to parse it. :D
to do this simply build the parser, then run,
'./bin/XmlParser <the file you wish to parse>'
